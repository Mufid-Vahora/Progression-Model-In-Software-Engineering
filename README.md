# Software-Engineering

In this study, we looked at how 84 software start-ups used software engineering to produce products that were cutting-edge and software-ferocious. In order to frame the findings and provide a launch-up life-cycle model, the domains of platoon, conditions engineering, values focuses, quality and testing, architecture and designs, and software development operation process were looked at. Similar architectural design emphasises the goals, challenges, and processes particular to each stage and process area.
